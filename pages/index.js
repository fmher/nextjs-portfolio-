                I'm a full-stack developer who comes from the love of video games. My love for video games sparked 
                an idea which brought me to coding. This simple exposure got me hooked into coding. I think getting
                 my first simple function to render got me hooked.
                It was so fastinating, fun, and challenging to get my code to work.
                Now, I believe that I am just passionate about technology. Technology is an tool that has no limits
                 and is constantly evolving. Just being able to work with tech would be great. Being able to
                implement my thoughts, ideas, and skills into a job would be my dream job. I graduated from 
                a bootcamp to become a software engineer.
                I believe that my bootcamp experience and exposure will help me become a software engineer that can
                thrive at any company.
